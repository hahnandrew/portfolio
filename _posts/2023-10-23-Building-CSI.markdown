Over the weekend, I was invited by Cornell Tech NYC to build at the AI for Public Good Hackathon. Our team aimted to target the high economic barrier that low income individuals face when they want to seal their criminal records. To understand our mission, it's important to first define some key concepts: 
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Criminal Records:</strong> These are official documents that contain a detailed history of an individual's interactions with law enforcement and the criminal justice system. This includes arrests, charges, convictions, and possibly other legal actions.</li>
  <li><strong>Sealing Criminal Records:</strong> This refers to the process of legally restricting the accessibility of an individual's criminal record. When a criminal record is sealed, it is not erased but becomes inaccessible to most people, including potential employers or landlords. This process is typically sought to improve opportunities for those who have been involved in the criminal justice system, as a criminal record can significantly hinder job prospects, housing opportunities, and other aspects of life.</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
Often times, sealing criminal records involves costly lawyer fees, or difficult-to-access pro-bono services. We wanted to address a significant challenge faced by low-income individuals who often want to seal their criminal records to improve their life prospects. However, the process can be expensive and complex, creating a high economic barrier. We wanted to use AI, specifically large language models, to simplify, expedite, and reduce the cost of this process, and make it more accessible to people who may lack the resources to navigate it on their own, leveling the playing field for disadvantaged groups.
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
After a user logs in, we gauge eligibility for our service with a series of questions regarding criminal convictions, time since last conviction, and more. Then, we ask the user to submit their records, and we then give a written document advocating for their case as to why their records should be sealed.
