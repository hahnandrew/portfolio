**Hello!** Iâ€™m **Andrew Hahn**, a multi-disciplined developer, particularly focused around building user-centered technology for healthcare and social good. I believe that with the right application, technology can be a powerful tool in bringing positive change to communities and societies at large.

Currently, I am studying computer science at **Cornell University**. I work as a research assistant for a computational biology lab developing software for phylodynamic analysis.
